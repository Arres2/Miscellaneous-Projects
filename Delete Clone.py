'''
    This script uses os lib methods to traverse a directory tree and do the following:
    - check each file and see if another file exists with same name but prepended with a string.  In this case, the string is "1-".
    I created this because of MusicBee music software for pc creating duplicates when I sync/transferred music to my sony nw-a45 hd music player because I 
      hadn't set up settings in MusicBee correctly.  
    This script could be easily modified to find duplicate files using other search criteria.
